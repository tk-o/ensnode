   * 1. If a renewal is made with 10 days incremental duration,
   *    the "registration lifecycle" for this name will remain in

   *    the "registration lifecycle" for this name will no longer be
   *    "expired" and will become "active", but the "registration lifecycle"
   *    will now be scheduled to expire again in 20 days.
   *
   * After the "registration lifecycle" for a name becomes expired by more
   * than its grace period, it can no longer be renewed by anyone and is
   * considered "released". The name must first be registered again, starting
