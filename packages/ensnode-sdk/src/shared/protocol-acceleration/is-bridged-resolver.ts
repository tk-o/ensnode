 * 2. That CCIP-Read Gateway exclusively consults a specific (shadow)Registry in order to identify
 *   a name's active resolver and resolve records, and
 * 3. Its behavior is unlikely to change (i.e. the contract is not upgradable or is unlikely to be
 *   upgraded in a way that violates principles 1. or 2.).
 *
 * The goal is to encode the pattern followed by projects like Basenames and Lineanames where a
 * wildcard resolver is used for subnames of base.eth and that L1Resolver always returns OffchainLookup
 * instructing the caller to consult a well-known CCIP-Read Gateway. This CCIP-Read Gateway then
 * exclusively behaves in the following way: it identifies the name's active resolver via a well-known
 * (shadow)Registry (likely on an L2), and resolves records on that active resolver.
 *
 * In these cases, if the Node-Resolver relationships for the (shadow)Registry in question are indexed,
 * then the CCIP-Read can be short-circuited, in favor of performing an _accelerated_ Forward Resolution
 * against the (shadow)Registry in question.
 *
 * TODO: these relationships could/should be encoded in an ENSIP
 * TODO: once Forward Resolution is updated for ENSv2, this likely just returns RegistryId
