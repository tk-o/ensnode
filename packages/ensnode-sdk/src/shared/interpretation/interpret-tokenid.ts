 * Decodes a uint256-encoded-LabelHash (eg. from a tokenId) into a {@link LabelHash}.
 *
 * Remember that contracts that operate in the context of a Managed Name frequently store and operate
 * over _LabelHashes_ that represent a direct subname of a Managed Name. These contracts also frequently
 * implement ERC721 or ERC1155 to represent ownership of these Names. As such, to construct the
 * ERC721/ERC1155 tokenId, they may encode the direct subnames's LabelHash as a uint256.
 *
 * This is true for the ENSv1 BaseRegistrar, RegistrarControllers, as well as any
 * contracts forked from it (which includes Basenames' and Lineanames' implementations).
 *
 * So, in order to turn the tokenId into a LabelHash, we perform the opposite operation, decoding
 * from a uint256 into a Hex (of size 32) and cast it as our semantic {@link LabelHash} type.
