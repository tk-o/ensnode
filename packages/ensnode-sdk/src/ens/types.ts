 * @example "0x076578616d706c650365746800" represents "example.eth"
 *
 * @see https://docs.ens.domains/resolution/names/#dns-encoding
 * @see https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/utils/NameCoder.sol
 *
 * DNS Packet Format for Domain Names:
 * - Domain names are encoded as a sequence of 0 or more labels
 * - Each label begins with a length byte (1 byte) indicating how many bytes follow for that label
 *   Note how this constrains each label in DNS encoded names to a max byte length of 255 bytes.
 * - The bytes after the length byte represent the label, as a UTF-8 byte array
 * - Labels are concatenated with no separators
 * - The sequence ends with a null byte (0x00)
 *
 * Example: "example.eth" is encoded as:
 * [0x07, 'e', 'x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e', 0x03, 'e', 't', 'h', 0x00]
 * Where 0x07 is the length of "example", 0x03 is the length of "eth", and 0x00 marks the end
 *
 * Example: "" (empty string, i.e. root node) is encoded as:
 * [0x00]
 *
 * Example: "👩🏼‍❤‍💋‍👨🏼.eth" (multi-byte unicode character) is encoded as:
 * [0x20, 240, 159, 145, 169, 240, 159, 143, 188, 226, 128, 141, 226, 157, 164, 226,
 * 128, 141, 240, 159, 146, 139, 226, 128, 141, 240, 159, 145, 168, 240, 159, 143,
 * 188, 3, 'e', 't', 'h', 0x00]
 *
 * A DNS-Encoded Name Packet may be malformed if it does not exactly follow that specification.
 * Possible reasons a DNS-Encoded Name may be malfomed include:
 * - 'empty' packet
 *   - e.g. []
 *           ^-- that's empty!
 * - 'length' byte overflowing packet byte length
 *   - e.g. [0x06, 'e', 't', 'h', 0x00]
 *            ^-- length overflows available bytes!
 * - 'junk' at the end of the dns-encoded
 *   - e.g. [0x03, 'e', 't', 'h', 0x00, 0x01]
 *                                       ^-- junk!
 *
 * @dev This type is _structurally_ typed to aid Event Argument Typing — consumers should further
 * cast the type of the event argument to a _nominally_ typed DNSEncodedName like {@link DNSEncodedLiteralName}
 * or {@link DNSEncodedPartiallyInterpretedName} depending on the context.
