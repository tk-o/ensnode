  /**
   * Incremental Duration
   *
   * Represents the incremental increase in the duration of the lifespan of

   * Measured in seconds.
   *
   * A name with an active registration can be renewed at any time.
   *
   * Names that have expired may still be renewable.
   *
   * For example: assume the registration of a direct subname of Ethnames is
   * scheduled to expire on Jan 1, midnight UTC. It is currently 30 days after
   * this expiration time. Therefore, there are currently another 60 days of
   * grace period remaining for this name. Anyone can still make
   * a renewal of this name.
   *
   * Consider the following scenarios for renewals of a name that
   * has expired but is still within its grace period:
   *
   * 1) Expired (in grace period) -> Expired (in grace period):
   *    If a renewal is made for 10 days incremental duration,
   *    this name remains in an "expired" (in grace period) state, but it now
   *    has 70 days of grace period remaining instead of only 60.
   *
   * 2) Expired (in grace period) -> Active:
   *    If a renewal is made for 50 days incremental duration,
   *    this name is no longer "expired" (in grace period) and is active, but it now
   *    expires and begins a new grace period in 20 days.
   *
   * After the latest registration of a direct subname becomes expired by
   * more than the grace period, it can no longer be renewed by anyone.
   * It must first be registered again, starting a new registration lifecycle of
   * active / expiry / grace period / etc.
