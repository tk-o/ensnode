# BOX: deterministically resolve per-chain end blocks for a target chain-time, using ONLY the
# ponder_sync cache (zero RPC). Prints `END_BLOCK_<chainId>=<block>` lines to stdout and writes a
# blocks manifest JSON to $MANIFEST_OUT. Used by the dev-checkpoint flow (END_BLOCK mode).
#
# For each chain, end block = the highest cached block whose timestamp <= $TIMESTAMP. The cache is
# sparse, so this lands on the nearest *cached* block; reproducible against a fixed seed.
#
# Env: TIMESTAMP (unix seconds, required), CHAIN_IDS (comma list, required), MANIFEST_OUT (required).
