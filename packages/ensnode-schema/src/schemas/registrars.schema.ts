 *
 * Note that this data model only tracks the *most recently created*
 * "registration lifecycle" record for a name and doesn't track

 * Therefore, if a name goes through multiple cycles of:
 * (registration -> expiry -> release) ->
 * (registration -> expiry -> release) -> etc..
 * this data model only stores data of the most recently created
 * "registration lifecycle".
 *
 * For now we make the following simplifying assumptions:
 * 1. That no two subregistries hold state for the same node.
 * 2. That the subregistry associated with the name X in the ENS root registry
 * exclusively holds state for subnames of X.
 *
 * These simplifying assumptions happen to be true for the scope of our
 * current indexing logic, but nothing in the ENS protocol fundamentally
 * forces this to always be true. Therefore this data model will need
 * refactoring in the future as our indexing logic expands to handle
 * more complex scenarios.

 * Each "logical action" in this table is associated with a single transaction.
 * However, it should be noted that a single transaction may perform any number
 * of "logical actions".
 *
 * For example, consider the "logical registrar action" of registering a direct
 * subname of .eth. This "logical action" spans interactions across multiple
 * contracts that emit multiple onchain events:
 *
 * 1. The "EthBaseRegistrar" contract emits a `NameRegistered` event enabling
 *    the tracking of data including:
 *    - `node`
 *    - `incrementalDuration`
 *    - `registrant`
 * 2. A "RegistrarController" contract emits its own `NameRegistered` event
 *    enabling the tracking of data that may include:
 *    - `baseCost`
 *    - `premium`
 *    - `total`
 *    - `encodedReferrer`
 *
 * Here we aggregate the state from both of these events into a single
