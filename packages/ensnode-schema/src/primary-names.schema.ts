 * - default.reverse
 * - [coinType].reverse
 * - NOT *.addr.reverse
 *
 * So these records CANNOT be queried directly and used as a source of truth — you MUST perform
 * Forward Resolution to resolve a consistent set of an Account's ENSIP-19 Primary Names. These records
 * are used to power Protocol Acceleration for those ReverseResolvers backed by a StandloneReverseRegistrar.

 * The emitted record values are interpreted according to `interpretNameRecordValue` — unnormalized
 * names and empty string values are interpreted as a deletion of the associated Primary Name entity.
 *
 * Note that this is an extension to the original subgraph schema and legacy subgraph compatibility
 * is not relevant.
