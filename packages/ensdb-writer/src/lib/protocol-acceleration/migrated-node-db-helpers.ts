/**
 * Why two tables for one logical "is this node migrated?" check.
 *
 * The check fires from many Registry handlers, but the event payload differs between them:
 *  - ENSv1Registry(Old)#NewOwner emits `parentNode` and `labelHash` as separate args.
 *  - ENSv1RegistryOld#Transfer / NewTTL / NewResolver emit only the post-namehash `node`
 *
 * Ponder's indexing-cache prefetch path predicts hot-table reads ahead of each event by deriving
 * the lookup key from the event's args — but its profile-pattern matcher can only do direct equality
 * and single-level string-delimiter splits. It can NOT invert keccak. So a table keyed by the
 * post-namehash `node` is unprofileable from a NewOwner event (where `node` is a computed namehash
 * of `(parentNode, labelHash)`), and a table keyed by `(parentNode, labelHash)` is unprofileable
 * from a Transfer/NewTTL/NewResolver event (which doesn't carry those fields).
 *
 * Either single-table choice surrenders prefetch on other handlers. Keying solely by
 * `(parentNode, labelHash)` would help the NewOwner hot path but disable prefetching on the other
 * three handlers, which can't reconstruct that pair from `node` without a reverse-index whose lookup
 * key is itself a un-prefetchable namehash.
 *
 * The two-table layout sidesteps both problems: write _both_ rows on every migration, then have each
 * read site address the table whose key matches its event payload. Both reads stay on the prefetch
 * hot-path. The cost is one extra "insert on conflict do nothing" per migration, and the storage of
 * that information, naturally, doubles. As of 2026-04-29, the size of the migrated_nodes_by_parent
 * table is ~1GB, meaning that this optimization will consume an additional ~1GB of storage but
 * will result in significantly faster indexing for the ENSv1Registry(Old) events.
 *
 * See {@link migratedNodeByParent} and {@link migratedNodeByNode} in the ensdb-sdk schema.
