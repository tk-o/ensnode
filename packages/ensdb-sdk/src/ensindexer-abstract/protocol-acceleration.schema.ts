 *
 * To store the necessary information required to implement this behavior, we track the set of nodes
 * that have been registered in the (new) Registry contract on the ENS Root Chain. When an event is
 * encountered on the RegistryOld contract, if the relevant node exists in this set, the event should
 * be ignored, as the node is considered migrated.
 *
 * Note that this logic is only necessary for the ENS Root Chain, the only chain that includes the
 * Registry migration: we do not track nodes in the the Basenames and Lineanames deployments of the
 * Registry on their respective chains, for example.
 *
 * Note also that this Registry migration tracking is isolated to the Protocol Acceleration schema/plugin.
 * That is, the subgraph plugin implements its own Registry migration logic. By isolating this logic
 * to the Protocol Acceleration plugin, we allow the Protocol Acceleration plugin to be run
 * independently of other plugins.
 *
 * The ensv2 plugin depends on the Protocol Acceleration plugin in order to piggyback on this
 * Registry migration logic.
