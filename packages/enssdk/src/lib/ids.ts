/**
 * Id format — dash-delimited tuples (perf trade-off, see #2016).
 *
 * Every composite id in this module joins its components with `-` rather than the canonical
 * CAIP-style mixed `:` / `/` delimiters. This is so that Ponder's indexing-cache profile-pattern
 * matcher can decompose the id into its parts (chainId, address, node, ...) and derive each
 * segment from event args (`event.chain.id`, `event.event.log.address`, `event.event.args.*`),
 * which is what enables prefetch on hot tables (Domain, Registry, Resolver, etc.). Under
 * CAIP-shaped ids the matcher's single-level string-delimiter split can't decompose a mixed
 * `:` / `/` payload, so prefetch silently never fires.
 *
 * Move back to CAIP-style ids once Ponder's matcher supports parsing CAIP-shaped composite
 * primary keys directly. This is a temporary shape, not the long-term one. Tracked in
 * https://github.com/namehash/ensnode/issues/2034.
 *
 * Note that because we key ENSv2 Domains by StorageId (necessary for stable identifier over time,
 * since its backing tokenId can change), which is _derived_ from the emitted arguments, ENSv2 Domains
 * aren't currently prefetchable, and likely won't be without a feature from Ponder that allows
 * consumers to specify the prefetch key generation per-entity.
