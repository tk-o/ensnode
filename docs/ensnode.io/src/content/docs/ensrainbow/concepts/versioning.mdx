ENSRainbow uses **three distinct version numbers**—each serving a different purpose.

## 1. ENSRainbow Software Version
The semantic version of the Node.js application itself (e.g. `v0.4.2`).
- Bumped when new features, fixes, or breaking changes are released.
- Shown in `/v1/version` under the `version` field.

## 2. Database Schema Version (`DB_SCHEMA_VERSION`)
Specifies the expected on-disk structure of the LevelDB database as well as the expected format of the downloadable pre-built LevelDB databases.
- Passed as an **environment variable** when running ENSRainbow.

:::caution[Mixing versions]
The API server will refuse to start if the on-disk database schema is different than the running software's expected schema.
:::

## 3. Label-set Version (`LABEL_SET_VERSION`)
Identifies incremental sets of rainbow records for a given label-set (`LABEL_SET_ID`).
- For each label-set, starts at **0** and increments by one with each incremental set of rainbow records.
- Each increment contains **only incremental additions** from all previous versions.
- Enables deterministic, reproducible healing results across time.


### Choosing Versions in Practice
| Scenario | Recommended `DB_SCHEMA_VERSION` | `LABEL_SET_ID` / `LABEL_SET_VERSION` |
|----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Local dev / tests | Latest | `ens-test-env / 0` |
| Production parity with ENS Subgraph | Latest | `subgraph / 0` |
| Maximum coverage | Latest | `searchlight / latest` |

For a complete list of available label sets and their versions, see the **[Available Label Sets](/ensrainbow/usage/available-label-sets/)** documentation page.
