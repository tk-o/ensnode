## Learning Path

If you're new to ENSRainbow, we recommend following this learning path:

1. **Start with the [Glossary](/ensrainbow/concepts/glossary/)** to familiarize yourself with key terms
2. **Read [Label Sets & Versioning](/ensrainbow/concepts/label-sets-and-versioning/)** to understand the core versioning concepts
3. **Review the [Data Model](/ensrainbow/concepts/data-model/)** to see how data is organized
4. **Check out [TypeScript Interfaces](/ensrainbow/concepts/typescript-interfaces/)** if you're planning to use the SDK

For deployment and operational considerations, also review [Technical Versioning](/ensrainbow/concepts/versioning/) and [Architecture](/ensrainbow/concepts/architecture/).

After understanding these concepts, you'll be ready to dive into the [Usage documentation](/ensrainbow/usage/) or [Contributing guides](/ensrainbow/contributing/).
