# enskit React Example

A minimal React app demonstrating how to use `enskit` and `enssdk` to query the ENS Omnigraph API.

The app connects to a local ENSNode instance and includes demos for browsing domains, registry cache usage, and paginated queries.

This app is hosted at [https://enskit-react-example.ensnode.io/](https://enskit-react-example.ensnode.io/) and pulls data from the NameHash-hosted Sepolia V2 Namespace.

## Usage (with NameHash Hosted Instance)

> **Version compatibility:** Our hosted ENSNode instances currently run ENSNode v1.13. If you are querying them from your own app, you **must** use `enskit@1.13.1` and `enssdk@1.13.1`. The latest published versions (`1.14.0+`) contain breaking changes in the Omnigraph API data model not yet deployed to our hosted infrastructure. This notice will be removed once the hosted instances are upgraded.

```sh
# from the ENSNode monorepo root
pnpm install

# set the VITE_ENSNODE_URL to a NameHash Hosted Instance and run this example in dev mode
VITE_ENSNODE_URL=https://api.alpha.ensnode.io pnpm -F enskit-react-example dev
```

## Usage (with Local ENSNode)

First, follow the [ENSNode Contributing Documentation](https://ensnode.io/docs/contributing) to get ENSNode running on your local machine. At the end of this, ENSApi should be available on port `:4334`.

```sh
# from the ENSNode monorepo root
pnpm install

# run this example in dev mode, defaults to connecting to an ENSApi at http://localhost:4334
pnpm -F enskit-react-example dev
```
