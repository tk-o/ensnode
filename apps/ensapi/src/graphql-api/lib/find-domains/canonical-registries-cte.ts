 * requirement that each Registry maintain a reverse-pointer to its Canonical Domain, a form of
 * 'edge authentication': if the reverse-pointer doesn't agree with the forward-pointer, the edge
 * is not traversed, making cycles within the direced graph impossible.
 *
 * So while technically not necessary, including the depth constraint avoids the possibility of an
 * infinite runaway query in the event that the indexed namegraph is somehow corrupted or otherwise
