 * Builds a `ReferralLeaderboard` from the database using the provided referral program rules (V1 API).

 * - PieSplit: uses aggregated referrer metrics (GROUP BY query).
 * - RevShareLimit: uses raw referral events (no GROUP BY) for the sequential race algorithm.

 * @param rules - The referral program rules for filtering registrar actions
 * @param accurateAsOf - The {@link UnixTimestamp} of when the data used to build the {@link ReferrerLeaderboard} was accurate as of.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a {@link ReferrerLeaderboard}
 * @throws Error if the database query fails
