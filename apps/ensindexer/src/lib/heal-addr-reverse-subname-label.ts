  // First, try healing with the transaction sender address.

  // NOTE: In most cases, the transaction sender calls `setName` on the ENS Registry, which may

  // sender address.
  //
  // Contract call:
  // https://etherscan.io/address/0x084b1c3c81545d370f3634392de611caabff8148#code#L106
  //
  // For these transactions, the transaction sender address is used to heal the reverse address label.
  //
  // Example transaction:
  // https://etherscan.io/tx/0x17697f8a43a9fc2d79ea8686366f2df3814a4dd6802272c06ce92cb4b9e5dc1b

  //
  // NOTE: Sometimes the transaction sender calls a proxy contract to interact with
  // the ENS Registry. In these cases, the ENS Registry sees the proxy contract as
  // the sender (`msg.sender`) and uses this address to create a reverse address record.
  // For these transactions, the `owner` address is used to heal the reverse address label.
  //
  // Example transaction:
  // https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf0109fcbba1cea0d42e744c1b5b69cc4ab99d1f7b3171aee4413d0426329a6bb

  // If previous healing methods failed, try addresses from transaction traces. In rare cases,
  // neither the transaction sender nor event owner is used for the reverse address record.
  // This can happen if the sender calls a factory contract that creates a new contract, which
  // then acquires a subdomain under a proxy-managed ENS name. The new contract's address is
  // used for the reverse record and is only found in traces, not as sender or owner.
  //
  // For these transactions, search the traces for addresses that could heal the label. All
  // caller addresses are included in traces. This brute-force method is a last resort, as it
  // requires an extra RPC call and parsing all addresses involved in the transaction.
  //
  // Example transaction:
  // https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9a6a5156f9f1fc6b1d5551483b97930df32e802f2f9229b35572170f1111134d
