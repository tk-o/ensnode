/**
 * Canonicality db helpers.
 *
 * A Registry is canonical iff it can be traced back to a Root Registry via bi-directionally agreed
 * upon canonical edges. A canonical edge between Registry R and parent Domain D requires both
 * unidirectional pointers to agree (`R.canonicalDomainId = D.id` ↔ `D.subregistryId = R.id`)
 * AND for D itself to be canonical. Root Registries (ENSv1 root, ENSv2 root) are canonical by
 * definition and seeded as Canonical at `ensureRegistry`-time.
 *
 * Concretely, this means a v1 Domain with a Bridged Resolver leaves its v1 children as non-canonical.
 * Example: mainnet `linea.eth` has a Bridged Resolver pointing at the Linea Chain's `linea.eth`
 * ENSv1VirtualRegistry. `bridge.linea.eth` exists on both mainnet (as a v1 child of mainnet's
 * `linea.eth` ENSv1VirtualRegistry) and Linea (as a child of the Linea Chain's `linea.eth`
 * ENSv1VirtualRegistry); but because mainnet's `linea.eth`'s Subregistry points at the Linea Chain's `linea.eth`
 * ENSv1VirtualRegistry agreement fails for `bridge.linea.eth` and it stays non-canonical (and so do
 * its theoretical children). Only the Linea-side `bridge.linea.eth` (the resolution-visible one) is
 * canonical. This mirrors the ENSv2 definition of Canonicality (nameability is derived from having
 * the Root Registry as the oldest ancestor).
 *
 * The unidirectional pointers `Registry.canonicalDomainId` and `Domain.subregistryId` are written
 * blindly when their onchain events fire, to store the on-chain state as-is. Edge authentication
 * is done on-demand at query time. The boolean flags `Registry.canonical` and `Domain.canonical`
 * are materialized from membership in the canonical nametree, and are kept up-to-date by reconciling
 * during updates to the uni-directional pointers.
 *
 * When `reconcileRegistryCanonicality` determines a Registry's flag actually flips, we cascade
 * the change through the canonical subgraph beneath it. Two paths:
 *   - If the Registry has no descendants (`Registry.__hasChildren = false`, the dominant case
 *     for fresh ENSv1 virtual registries on first wire-up), the cascade is a single-row flag
 *     flip done via an in-memory PK update. No raw SQL, no flush. This optimization no-ops
 *     the expensive reconciliation CTE for all ENSv1 Domains.
 *   - Otherwise, a single recursive-CTE batch UPDATE walks the canonical subgraph via the
 *     unidirectional pointers + inline agreement check, batch-updating every visited Registry
 *     and its child Domains. This goes through `context.ensDb.sql`, which forces a Ponder cache
 *     flush + invalidate. We accept that cost because it's bounded to Registries that have
 *     children AND whose canonicality actually flips — i.e. bridged-resolver attach/detach and
 *     ENSv2 reparenting on already-populated subtrees.
 *
 * `__hasChildren` is a monotonic sentinel on `Registry` (false → true on the first child Domain
 * registered under it; never reset). See `ensureDomainInRegistry` for where it is flipped.
 */

/**
 * Idempotently inherit `canonical` on `domainId` from its parent `registryId`, and mark the
 * parent Registry as having children (`__hasChildren = true`).
 *
 * Because of the invariant that Registry exist before Domain (thankfully true in both protocols),
 * when a Domain is added to a Registry, the Registry's `canonical` flag has already been reconciled.
 * So the new Domain trivially inherits the parent's current flag with no cascade required, since a
 * brand-new Domain has no children of its own (thanks again to the above invariant).
 *
 * The `__hasChildren` write flips the parent Registry's sentinel from false to true on the
 * first child Domain ever registered under it. The sentinel is monotonic (Domain rows aren't
 * deleted and `domain.registryId` is set at creation and never mutated), so once flipped it
 * stays true forever. `cascadeCanonicality` reads it to skip the SQL flush when there are
 * provably no descendants to update.
