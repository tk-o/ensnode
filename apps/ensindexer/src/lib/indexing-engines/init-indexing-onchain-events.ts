 * Initialize indexing of "onchain" events

 * This function is guaranteed to be called exactly once by
 * `eventHandlerPreconditions` before executing any "onchain" event handlers,
 * and is used to initialize the ENSNode Schema.
 *
 * Each time the ENSIndexer instance starts, the logic in this function will be
 * executed. Therefore, all logic must be idempotent and concurrency-safe,
 * to prevent any issues during the startup of the ENSIndexer instance.
 * For example, multiple ENSIndexer instances might be started at the same time,
 * and they might all execute the logic in this function concurrently,
 * so we need to make sure that this does not cause any unexpected side effects.
