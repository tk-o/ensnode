/**
 * Get the incremental duration for Renewal action.
 *
 * Definition of "incremental duration" is
 * the incremental increase in the lifespan of a registration.
 *
 * Please consider the following situation:
 *
 * A registration of direct subname of Ethnames is scheduled to expire on
 * Jan 1, midnight UTC. It is currently 30 days after this expiration time.
 * Therefore, there are currently another 60 days of grace period remaining
 * for this name. Anyone can now make a renewal of this name.
 *
 * There are two possible scenarios when a renewal is made:
 *
 * 1) If a renewal is made for 10 days incremental duration,
 *    this name remains in an "expired" state, but it now
 *    has another 70 days of grace period remaining.
 *
 * 2) If a renewal is made for 50 days incremental duration,
 *    this name is no longer "expired" and is active, but it now
 *    expires in 20 days.
 *
 * After the latest registration of a direct subname becomes expired by
 * more than the grace period, it can no longer be renewed by anyone.
 * It must first be registered again, starting a new registration lifecycle of
 * expiry / grace period / etc.
 *
 * @param currentRegistration The current indexed registration.
 * @param registrationWillExpireAt The timestamp that is about to replace
 *        the `expiresAt` field of the `currentRegistration`.
 *
 * @returns incremental duration in seconds.
 * @throws if no related Registration was indexed before.
