/**
 * Returns whether `resolverAddress` on `chainId` is a Known Onchain Static Resolver.
 *
 * Onchain Static Resolvers must abide the following pattern:
 * 1. Onchain: all information necessary for resolution is stored on-chain, and
 * 2. Static: All resolve() calls resolve to the exact value previously emitted by the Resolver in
 *    its events (i.e. no post-processing or other logic, a simple return of the on-chain data).
 *   2.a the Resolver MAY implement address record defaulting and still be considered Static (see below).
 * 3. Its behavior is unlikely to change (i.e. the contract is not upgradable or is unlikely to be
 *   upgraded in a way that violates principles 1. or 2.).
 *
 * NOTE: ContractConfig['address'] can be Address | Address[] but we know all of these are just Address
 *
 * TODO: these relationships could be encoded in an ENSIP
