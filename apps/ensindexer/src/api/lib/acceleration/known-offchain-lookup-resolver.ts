/**
 * For a given `resolverAddress` on a specific `chainId`, return the `PluginName` that, if it were
 * active, indexes all Domains (and Resolvers) necessary to answer resolution requests.
 *
 * These Offchain Lookup Resolvers must abide the following pattern:
 * 1. They _always_ emit OffchainLookup for any resolve() call to a well-known CCIP-Read Gateway
 * 2. That CCIP-Read Gateway exclusively sources the data necessary to process CCIP-Read Requests from
 *   the indicated chain.
 * 3. Its behavior is unlikely to change (i.e. the contract is not upgradable or is unlikely to be
 *   upgraded in a way that violates principles 1. or 2.).
 *
 * The intent is to encode the following information:
 * - base.eth name on ENS Root Chain always emits OffchainLookup to resolve against the
 *   (sub-)Registry on Base (or Base Sepolia, etc)
 * - linea.eth name on ENS Root Chain always emits OffchainLookup to resolve against the
 *   (sub-)Registry on Linea (or Linea Sepolia, etc)
 *
 * NOTE: ContractConfig['address'] can be Address | Address[] but we know all of these are just Address
 *
 * TODO: these relationships could/should be encoded in an ENSIP, likely as a mapping from
 * resolverAddress to (sub-)Registry on a specified chain.
