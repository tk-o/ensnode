/**
 * Handlers for pre-ENSIP-19 ReverseResolver contracts. Their purpose is to index
 * just the `name` records, in order to power Protocol Acceleration for ENSIP-19 L2 Primary Names.
 *
 * It specifically:
 * 1) upsert Resolver entities, and
 * 2) indexe the `name` record emitted by Resolver contracts
 *
 * Note that this handler _doesn't_ need to:
 * 1) upsert Account entities, or
 * 2) insert Resolver events,
 * as those actions are performed by the standard Resolver handlers (which will also run for the
 * specified events on this contract, if the user has enabled a plugin that registers them,
 * since this Contract is also a Resolver).
